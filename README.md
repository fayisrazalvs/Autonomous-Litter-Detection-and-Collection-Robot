# Autonomous-Litter-Detection-and-Collection-Robot

## INTRODUCTION 

This project aims to develop an autonomous litter detection and collection robot using the TensorFlow Lite libraries to run object detection on a Raspberry Pi. The idea of the robot is to be mobile and detect litter objects along its path and use a collection mechanism to collect the litter object and drop it into a container mounted on the body of the robot.

It is a very ambitious project which requires complex algorithms, circuits and mechanical design to operate effectively. But for the time being, I have developed a simple design and system to execute the fundamental concept of this project for my final semester project. This project is my second project in robotics and at a significantly higher level than my previous one. This project will always be a work in progress until an outcome that satisfies me is achieved.
